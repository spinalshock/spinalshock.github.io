# Firenvim - Neovim Experience in your browser!

I recently chanced upon **Firenvim** while working on the [pastebin](spinalshock.github.io/paste/) where I tried to replicate the VIM experience on my page. This plugin allows you to work on any textarea by layering your **Nvim GUI** over it. You can use most of your plugins and all your keymaps as if you were working inside your terminal. It works by activating a Nvim instance in the background and acts as a remote UI client for your Nvim.

## Setup

- First we begin by adding this plugin inside of neovim

```lua
--- Installation for Lazy

{ 'glacambre/firenvim', build = ':call firenvim#install(0)' },

```

- Next, we add the firenvim browser extension:
  - [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firenvim/)
  - [Chromium](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/firenvim/egpjdkipkomnmjhjmdamaniclmdlobbo)

## Configuration

Read the [official readme](https://github.com/glacambre/firenvim#configuring-firenvim) for detailed documentation on how to configure firenvim for your usecase.

### Troubleshooting

Now it should begin to automatically take over textareas and start a Nvim instance. In case it fails, just try restarting your browser or going in your **browser extensions > starting developer mode > Inspect views Background page**

Visit the github [Troubleshooting Page](https://github.com/glacambre/firenvim/blob/master/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for detailed instructions on steps to follow.
