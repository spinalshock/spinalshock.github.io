# **Welcome**

Welcome to my blog. I am excited to share my thoughts and experiences with you. I hope you find my blog interesting and informative. I will be posting regularly, so please check back often for new content.

## **Why I started this blog**

My inspiration to start this blog stems from a thought-provoking article on **C. Wright Mills**' 1959 book _The Sociological Imagination_, specifically the appendix titled _"On Intellectual Craftsmanship"_. In it, Mills encourages aspiring intellectuals to keep a "file"—a personal record of not just ideas, but also experiences, dreams, readings, fleeting thoughts, challenges, and successes. He argues that the most insightful thinkers do not separate their work from their lives; instead, they intertwine the two, using each to enrich the other.

To have experience, according to Mills, means recognizing that our past continually influences our present, which, in turn, shapes our future capabilities. By maintaining a record of our thoughts and experiences, we can engage in ongoing reflection and interpretation, ultimately fostering systematic thinking. This practice not only serves as a source of intellectual work but also helps us develop a toolkit for navigating obstacles in both our professional and personal lives. Moreover, this record becomes a personal database of insights to revisit and build upon over time.

While I was deeply influenced by Mills' philosophy, my reasons for starting this blog aren’t quite as grand. In everyday life, I’ve noticed a growing gap between my thoughts and actions. Often, I find myself thinking about things I want to do but never quite follow through. Laziness, poor habits, and a lack of discipline are usually to blame. Through this blog, I aim to bridge that gap, giving myself a regular space to reflect, reinforce, and act on my ideas.

By writing regularly, I hope to turn this process into a habit that not only sharpens my writing and typing skills but also improves my ability to think and articulate ideas clearly. Writing was second nature to me in school—whether in essays or in discussions about books and topics—but over time, it has become more challenging. I intend to write about a range of topics: how challenges at work were overcome, what I learned from an interesting conversation, or even insights from everyday experiences, such as games I’ve played or books I’ve read. Every time I encounter something thought-provoking, I hope to jot down my feelings and reflections.

This blog will not be solely a space for personal reflection. I also aim for it to serve as a searchable knowledge repository—a personal Wikipedia of sorts. Here, I can look back at previous solutions, ideas, and insights, building on them over time. Through this process, I hope to become the kind of **intellectual craftsman** that Mills describes. I want to use this blog not only to enrich my own life but, hopefully, to benefit my readers as well.
